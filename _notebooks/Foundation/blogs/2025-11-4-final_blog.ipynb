    "When I first started this class, I had a vague idea as to what VSCode and github were, but I had little to no actual experience with them. I thought terminal was a thing only for computer professionals and only used if your computer was broken. I didn't know what github pages were, and I had never used a Kanban board before. I joined the class due to my curiosity about the subject as well as interest and desire to learn more about coding and games in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after finishing the first trimester of this class, I am able to say that I am pretty fluent at using tools such as github and VSCode. Jupyter Notebooks was something I didn't even know existed, but now I am able to write blog posts such as this one with images, typography such as bolding and underlining, and links to different sites. I am able to make games and work on games as shown through the progress I made while working on snake, rock paper scissors, and the mansion game.\n",

The image shows me typing into a <u>Jupyter Notebook</u>, a way to type code in nodes. I'm currently working in a <b>markdown</b> node, meaning the code I type has to be in the markdown language. You can also see where I was typing I put a <u>ubuntu_terminal.png</u>, which is the ubuntu terminal image you saw before.\n",

    "\n",
    "This presentation was something that I was most proud of to finish with my group. Not only because my teacher complemented the work that was put into and the contents of the presentation, but also because of how long we spent trying to get this to work. I learned how to change the background of a blog post. I also learned how to make and use buttons properly through my work on the gamify projects like rock paper scissors. Throughout the time I spent on this project, my skill with working with Jupyter Notebooks skyrocketed. This was also on top of the fact that I was able to fully make this project without any use of A.I. whatsoever. Before, I would occassionally use A.I. for a small part I wouldn't understand, but now I was proficient enough in Jupyter Notebooks to not have to rely on it at all. This showed a milestone that I had reached in which I didn't need to rely on any tools to finish a project.\n",

    "\n",
    "This was by far the biggest project I had done in this class. It was the first actual game we had made, and took the most amount of time. In this project, I learned more than ever about how classes work, as I was forced to use them to make things such as NPCs, enemies, and the main player. I'm proud to say that our group had Aarush, who was the one who made majority of the sprites. Jonah also did majority of the work in the game, as well as helped me understand multiple things throughout this entire class. In fact, without Jonah, I don't think I would even have VSCode setup. Besides that however, this mansion game project, made me learn the reality of how difficult it is to make games, especially if it is your first time using a game engine that you have never used before. This is the first time I have ever made a fully completed game, so even though it has small bugs it was a big accomplishment.<br/><br/>\n",
