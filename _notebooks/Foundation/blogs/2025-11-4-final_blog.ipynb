    "## Before\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "When I first started this class, I had a vague idea as to what VSCode and github were, but I had little to no actual experience with them. I thought terminal was a thing only for computer professionals and only used if your computer was broken. I didn't know what github pages were, and I had never used a Kanban board before. I joined the class due to my curiosity about the subject as well as interest and desire to learn more about coding and games in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## After\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Now, after finishing the first trimester of this class, I am able to say that I am pretty fluent at using tools such as github and VSCode. Jupyter Notebooks was something I didn't even know existed, but now I am able to write blog posts such as this one with images, typography such as bolding and underlining, and links to different sites. I am able to make games and work on games as shown through the progress I made while working on snake, rock paper scissors, and the mansion game.\n",

    "### Part 1: Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I learned how to set up was the terminal. I started using the linux subsystem for windows, with Ubuntu. In fact, the Ubuntu terminal is how i'm able to even make this blog:<br/><br/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/notebooks/foundation/ubuntu_terminal.png\" alt=\"Ubuntu Terminal\">\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "The picture shows the Ubuntu terminal that I used to open this VSCode window. I learned how to manage my folders and directories, as well as how to clone github repositories in the terminal to run in VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said previously, I have been editing this in VSCode. VSCode is a tool I have learned to use in this class to make the games we have worked on along with the different blogs I have made.<br/><br/>\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/notebooks/foundation/blog_vscode.png\" alt=\"VScode Blog\"><br/>\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "In the picture above, you can see in the bottom left that VSCode is being ran in WSL: Ubuntu, which means the windows subsystem for linux, with the Ubuntu linux distribution. At the middle top, you can see that this is the student repository, meaning on my <a href=\"https://github.com/Grot710\">github account</a>, you will find the student repository in which all of my files for this website are on. The image shows me typing into a <u>Jupyter Notebook</u>, a way to type code in nodes. I'm currently working in a <b>markdown</b> node, meaning the code I type has to be in the markdown language. You can also see where I was typing I put a <u>ubuntu_terminal.png</u>, which is the ubuntu terminal image you saw before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 2: Javascript Lessons/Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the second sprint, I learned how to use javascript fundamentals such as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Data Abstraction</li>\n",
    "<li>Arrays</li>\n",
    "<li>Loops</li>\n",
    "<li>Variables</li>\n",
    "<li>Classes</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only did making these lessons increase my proficiency with using markdown in Jupyter, it also helped me develop my ability to use javascript with the homework provided and the making of homework for my own lessons.\n",
