    "When I first started this class, I had a vague idea as to what VSCode and github were, but I had little to no actual experience with them. I thought terminal was a thing only for computer professionals and only used if your computer was broken. I didn't know what github pages were, and I had never used a Kanban board before. I joined the class due to my curiosity about the subject as well as interest and desire to learn more about coding and games in general.\n",

    "### After\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after finishing the first trimester of this class, I am able to say that I am pretty fluent at using tools such as github and VSCode. Jupyter Notebooks was something I didn't even know existed, but now I am able to write blog posts such as this one with images, typography such as bolding and underlining, and links to different sites. I am able to make games and work on games as shown through the progress I made while working on snake, rock paper scissors, and the mansion game.\n",

    "This presentation was something that I was most proud of to finish with my group. Not only because my teacher complemented the work that was put into and the contents of the presentation, but also because of how long we spent trying to get this to work. I learned how to change the background of a blog post. I also learned how to make and use buttons properly through my work on the gamify projects like rock paper scissors. Throughout the time I spent on this project, my skill with working with Jupyter Notebooks skyrocketed. This was also on top of the fact that I was able to fully make this project without any use of A.I. whatsoever. Before, I would occassionally use A.I. for a small part I wouldn't understand, but now I was proficient enough in Jupyter Notebooks to not have to rely on it at all. This showed a milestone that I had reached in which I didn't need to rely on any tools to finish a project.\n",

    "## Chapter 4: Quest of Spook\n",
    "\n",
    "This was by far the biggest project I had done in this class. It was the first actual game we had made, and took the most amount of time. In this project, I learned more than ever about how classes work, as I was forced to use them to make things such as NPCs, enemies, and the main player. I'm proud to say that our group had Aarush, who was the one who made majority of the sprites. Jonah also did majority of the work in the game, as well as helped me understand multiple things throughout this entire class. In fact, without Jonah, I don't think I would even have VSCode setup. Besides that however, this mansion game project, made me learn the reality of how difficult it is to make games, especially if it is your first time using a game engine that you have never used before. This is the first time I have ever made a fully completed game, so even though it has small bugs it was a big accomplishment.<br/><br/>\n",

    "My group was in charge of making the 5th level of the mansion, a zombie survival game in which the main character, <b>Spook</b>, had to walk around the library avoiding the waves of zombies that spawned to eventually get to the final level. This game required me to learn more about the collision detection system, as well as player movement and how to animate characters. I learned how to use the animations so that I could make both the player work by cycling through different frames of the full player spritesheet. Collision detection however, was probably the most important part of the project. Without it, I would be unable to actually kill the zombies properly, and the projectiles and attacks would simply phase through the enemy. To make collision work, I used references from the detection code that was provided from previous games made by students. In the end, me and my group ended up with a level that was good, but still could definitely have been improved. However, overall, I believe that our level was extremely well made for the amount of experience we had and time constraints.\n",

    "Due to this lag, the game was a lot laggier and would cause collision bugs with the projectile.<br/><br/>\n",
    "The game had a very good idea, however the execution was fairly poor and incomplete. I believe if worked on longer, the game could be made into a proper game.\n",

    "<b><u>Sprint 1</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the introductory sprint, the beginning of the class. This sprint taught me a lot about how to use:\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>VSCode</li>\n",
    "<li>Github</li>\n",
    "<li>Terminal</li>\n",

    "<li>Github Pages</li>\n",
    "<li>Much more</li>\n",

    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/notebooks/foundation/github-image.png\" alt=\"Github image\"><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one thing that I stopped using from sprint 1 was the <code>make</code> command. When I first started using VSCode and Jupyter, I used make a lot to test how my blogs worked, however as I progressed through the other sprints, I realized it was better to make commits and test it on the deploy instead.<br/><br/>\n",
    "This is because testing on the deploy means it will look the same for everyone in public, however on make there can be slight differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Sprint 2</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint was focused mostly on Javascript. The main takeaway I have from this sprint is the javascript fundamentals I learned, however I already talked about this previously.\n",

    "Besides the javascript, this lesson helped me refine my ability to use markdown with tables and more for my blog posts.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Though this was definitely not the best sprint, the ideas it taught me stayed until sprint 3 and will continue to stay with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Sprint 3</u></b>\n",

    "This sprint added on to my lessons learned from sprint 2, and encouraged my growth in using javascript.<br/><br/>\n",
